        <p><i class="fas fa-person-booth"></i><br>Voting has never been easier! Built entirely
            as a smart contract on the Ethereum
            Blockchain, DeVote takes E-Voting a thousand steps forward.
            Each citizen has a unique voting address with one public and one
            heavily encrypted private key. On top of that on election day the voters
            undergo a series of authentication processes to prove their
            identity. With DeVote YOU control YOUR future from the comfort
            of your living room or anywhere via tablet/phone.</p>

        <p><i class="far fa-question-circle"></i> Why DeVote?</p>
        <p>Over the past couple of years two things have been growing rapidly - distrust in mainstream politics and
            blockchain technology.
            Although not connected, these two preconditions have given birth to a need for change in the core of the
            electoral systems around the world. We firmly believe that DeVote meets all requirements for a transparent
            voting process. In it's current 1.0 version it only supports a two-candidate election, upgrades are coming soon.</p>

        <p>You can test the application without running any additional software or even creating an ethereum wallet.
            We've created a simple javascript demo that looks and acts exactly like the real smart contract app! It's
            basically a
            simulation of what the 2016 US presidential elections would look like if they were held on DeVote. (Keep
            in mind that the timer is set for 20 seconds
            for demo purposes, in real life it would be active for 2 days)
            Give it a try <a href="/demo/"><span>here</span></a>.</p>

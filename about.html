        <p><i class="far fa-question-circle"></i> Why DeVote?</p>
        <p>Over the past couple of years two things have been growing rapidly - distrust in mainstream politics and
            blockchain technology.
            Although not connected, these two preconditions have given birth to a need for change in the core of the
            electoral systems around the world. We firmly believe that DeVote meets all requirements for a transparent
            voting process.</p>

        <p>You can test the application without running any additional software or even creating an ethereum wallet.
            We've created a simple javascript demo that looks and acts exactly like the real smart contract app! It's
            basically a
            simulation of what the 2016 US presidential elections would look like if they were held on DeVote.
            Give it a try <a href="/demo/"><span>here</span></a>.</p>
